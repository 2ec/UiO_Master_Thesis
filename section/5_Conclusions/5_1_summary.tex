\section{Summary}
\begin{comment}
    Here you summarize and conclude the thesis, and it contains a lot of repetitions from previous chapters. Often, it has been structured in the following three sections, but sometimes they are also merged (especially the first two).

% Main findings
\begin{comment}
     the Alpaca-VQA model trained on the current dataset has learned to exploit linguistic biases, possibly combined with taking advantage of the dataset used being unbalanced. The language-only Alpaca-VQA model achieved higher accuracy when tested with language-only data than the one tested with questions and images. The conclusion drawn from this finding is that the model has learned to rely more on language than visual features, which could have implications for future research.

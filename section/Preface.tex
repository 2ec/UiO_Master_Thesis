Foreword / Preface / Acknowledgements
This is the place for "informal chat" like how the master thesis task has progressed and acknowledgment to those who one feels for thanking. One can also include what kind of software that has been used in the master thesis work. Some choose to have the foreword before the Table of Contents (TOC).

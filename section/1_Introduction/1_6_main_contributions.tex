It is important to “sell” your work to the reader, making him interested and impressed with your accomplishments. Thus, you should briefly summarize what you have done, list your main results, drawn conclusions and knowledge gained - and put it back in the context of your problem statement. Show how you solved the initial problem or answered the research questions!

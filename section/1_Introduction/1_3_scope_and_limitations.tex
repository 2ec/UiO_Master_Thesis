\begin{comment}
Here you can tell the reader about the scope of your thesis, kind of meaning describing what you have done in slighter more detail. The question in section 1.2 might be of the general type, but are you using any specific case studies/application scenarios? Are you limited to a specific type of platform? Have you performed experiments in special environments only, etc.? Describe such information here so that the reader does not expect something going beyond this.

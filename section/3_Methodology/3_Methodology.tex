This chapter may have many names. Lately, many have named it “Methodology”, but names like “Design and Implementation”, a “name” of a developed system, etc. are also often used. Just find a name that matches your research. Regardless, the important thing here is to describe YOUR research.

INTRO: Again, start the chapter with a sentence or two explaining why you have this chapter (repeating the last sentences from the proposed summary in the previous chapter) - assuming that some readers have not read the previous chapter.

MIDDLE SECTIONS: What are your ideas? Your solutions. How have you done “things”? Implementation details. Frameworks used. Etc. Also, discuss alternative ways of doing things and explain why you have chosen to do things as you have. WHAT! HOW! WHY!

SUMMARY: End this chapter with a summary section. Summarize what you have done and why! Main knowledge gained. What have we learned? Lead to the next chapter, stating that you will test your prototype.

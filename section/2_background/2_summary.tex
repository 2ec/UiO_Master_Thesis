SUMMARY: Often, we recommend ending this chapter (and all chapters after except the conclusion) with a summary section. The aim is to give an overview of, and tea-spoon-feeding the reader with, what he/she should have learned reading this chapter. What can be concluded from this chapter? How does the information given here give
 
arguments for your problem statement? Finally, lead to the next chapter (“... and we will therefore in the next chapter address these challenges, and describe our ideas/implementation/...”)
